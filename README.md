# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model
A machine learning project that classifies breast tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from Kaggle. The solution applies the Random Forest algorithm with hyperparameter tuning and achieves over 95% accuracy.
There is a Random Forest Model in the zip file and an iterface script in python which need to be copy and pasted and the path must me set for the trained file.
